# Feature Specification: JSON.md Reader with TanStack Ecosystem

**Feature Branch**: `001-json-md-tanstack`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "读取 json.md，通过tanstack start以及tanstack生态工具来完成这个需求"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: JSON file reading, TanStack ecosystem usage
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Users who need to read JSON files
   → Actions: Read, parse, display JSON content from .md files
   → Data: JSON data embedded in markdown files
   → Constraints: Must use TanStack ecosystem
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Define user interaction flows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
   → JSON data, Markdown files, User interface
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to read and view JSON content that is embedded within markdown files (specifically json.md), so that I can easily access and understand structured data without having to manually parse the file.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user accesses the application, **When** they select or open json.md, **Then** the system MUST display the JSON content in a readable, structured format
2. **Given** a json.md file contains valid JSON content, **When** the system processes the file, **Then** the JSON data MUST be properly parsed and displayed without errors
3. **Given** the json.md file contains invalid JSON, **When** the system attempts to parse it, **Then** the system MUST display a clear error message indicating the parsing failure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the json.md file is empty or missing?
- How does the system handle JSON content that is very large or complex?
- How does the system handle markdown files with mixed content (JSON + other markdown)?
- What happens when the JSON contains nested structures or special formatting?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to read and access json.md file content
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse JSON content embedded within markdown files
- **FR-003**: System MUST display parsed JSON data in a structured, human-readable format
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide error handling for invalid or malformed JSON content
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle files that contain both JSON and other markdown content

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **JSON Document**: Represents the structured data content extracted from markdown files, containing key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects
- **Markdown File**: The source file format containing JSON content, specifically json.md, which may include both JSON data and markdown formatting
- **Parsed Data View**: The visual representation of JSON data after processing, presented in a structured format for user consumption
- **Error State**: Represents system response when JSON parsing fails, including error messages and handling procedures
