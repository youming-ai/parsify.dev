# Research Findings: JSON.md Reader with TanStack Ecosystem

## Technology Decisions

### TanStack Start Framework
**Decision**: Use TanStack Start as the primary framework
**Rationale**:
- Provides SSR capabilities with TanStack Router integration
- Built-in support for TanStack Query for data fetching
- TypeScript-first approach with excellent developer experience
- Aligns with user requirement to use TanStack ecosystem
**Alternatives considered**: Next.js, Vite + React, Remix

### File Processing Strategy
**Decision**: Client-side file processing with File API
**Rationale**:
- No server infrastructure required for simple file reading
- Direct file access through browser File API
- Maintains privacy (no file upload to server)
- Simpler deployment and maintenance
**Alternatives considered**: Node.js backend server, Cloud function processing

### JSON Extraction Approach
**Decision**: Regex-based markdown parsing for JSON extraction
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight client-side solution
- Fast processing for typical file sizes
- No external parsing dependencies required
- Can handle mixed markdown + JSON content
**Alternatives considered**: Markdown AST parsing, External markdown libraries

## Performance Considerations

### File Size Handling
- Target files up to 1MB for optimal performance
- Implement streaming parsing for larger files if needed
- Add file size validation before processing

### Parsing Performance
- JSON parsing using native JSON.parse() (fastest option)
- Regex markdown extraction optimized for common patterns
- Lazy loading of JSON viewer components

## User Experience Design Decisions

### JSON Viewer Component
- Collapsible tree view for nested objects
- Syntax highlighting for JSON keys and values
- Search functionality within JSON data
- Copy-to-clipboard for individual values or entire JSON

### Error Handling Strategy
- Clear error messages for invalid JSON
- Graceful handling of malformed markdown
- User-friendly file selection interface
- Retry mechanisms for failed parsing attempts

## Technical Implementation Details

### TanStack Query Integration
- Use QueryClient for JSON parsing state management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Cache parsing results for performance
- Handle loading states appropriately

### File API Integration
- Use FileReader API for local file access
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality
- Support both .md and .txt file extensions
- Validate file content before processing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- JSON extraction function testing
- File parsing utility testing
- Component behavior testing
- Error scenario testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end file reading workflow
- JSON viewer interaction testing
- Error boundary testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Contract Testing
- File API interface testing
- JSON parsing interface testing
- Component prop interface testing

## Accessibility Considerations

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper ARIA labels for JSON viewer
- Keyboard navigation for tree view
- Announce parsing status and errors
- High contrast mode support

### Performance Accessibility
- Loading indicators for large files
- Progressive JSON rendering
- Memory usage monitoring
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Processing
- No file uploads to external servers
- Local-only file processing
- Memory cleanup after processing
- Input sanitization for displayed content

### XSS Prevention
- Safe JSON rendering (no HTML injection)
- Proper escaping of displayed content
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Validation of parsed JSON structure

## Deployment Considerations

### Static Site Hosting
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- No server-side processing requirements
- CDN optimization for assets
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- File processing performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- User interaction analytics
