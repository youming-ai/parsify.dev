# Research: Online Developer Tools Platform

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: Developer Tools Platform MVP
**Scope**: JSON tools, code formatting, online execution, basic infrastructure

## Technology Decisions

### Cloudflare Native Architecture
**Decision**: Full Cloudflare stack (Pages, Workers, D1, KV, R2, Durable Objects)
**Rationale**:
- Unified platform reduces operational complexity
- Edge-first performance for global user base
- Built-in security and scaling
- Cost-effective for MVP and growth stages
- WASM-first runtime for secure code execution

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vercel + AWS: More complex operations, higher cost
- Traditional hosting: Poorer performance, more infrastructure management
- Hybrid approach: Increased complexity without clear benefits

### TypeScript Full-Stack
**Decision**: TypeScript 5.x for both frontend and backend
**Rationale**:
- Type safety across the entire stack
- Shared types between frontend and backend
- Strong ecosystem support
- Better developer experience and maintainability
- Native WASM compilation support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JavaScript: Less type safety, more runtime errors
- Multiple languages: Increased complexity, type boundaries

### Frontend Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router and Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**:
- Mature ecosystem with excellent Cloudflare Pages support
- App Router provides modern React patterns
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- shadcn/ui for consistent component library
- SSR/Edge functions support for optimal performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Remix: Less mature ecosystem, fewer components
- Astro: Limited dynamic capabilities for tool interactions
- Vanilla React: More boilerplate, less opinionated structure

### Backend Framework: Hono
**Decision**: Hono framework on Cloudflare Workers
**Rationale**:
- Optimized for edge runtime
- TypeScript-first design
- Excellent middleware ecosystem
- Simple routing and API structure
- Strong Cloudflare Workers integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Itty Router: Too minimal for complex API needs
- Worktop: Less maintained, smaller ecosystem
- Custom Workers runtime: More development overhead

### Database Strategy: D1 + KV + R2
**Decision**: Multi-storage approach optimized for use cases
**Rationale**:
- D1 for relational data (users, jobs, tools)
- KV for caching and session data
- R2 for file storage and job outputs
- Durable Objects for state management and rate limiting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- External database (PostgreSQL): Higher latency, more cost
- Single storage solution: Performance trade-offs

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Comprehensive testing with Vitest, Playwright, Miniflare
**Rationale**:
- Vitest for fast unit testing with TypeScript support
- Playwright for E2E testing across browsers
- Miniflare for Workers integration testing
- OpenAPI for contract testing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Jest: Slower execution, less TypeScript integration
- Cypress: More resource intensive, vendor lock-in

## Tool Implementation Research

### JSON Processing
**Libraries**: simdjson-wasm (high performance), ajv (validation), sheetjs-wasm (Excel conversion)
**Performance**: simdjson-wasm provides 10x faster JSON parsing than native JS
**Security**: WASM sandbox provides isolation for malicious JSON processing

### Code Execution
**Languages**:
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Native V8 execution
- Python: Pyodide WASM build
- C/C++/Go/Rust: Pre-compiled WASM modules

**Security Model**:
- No external network access
- 256MB memory limit
- 5-second execution timeout
- Resource quotas per user tier

### Image Processing
**Primary**: Cloudflare Images API for common operations
**Fallback**: wasm-imagemagick for complex processing
**Formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, TIFF support
**Limits**: 10MB free user, 100MB premium

### Rate Limiting Strategy
**Implementation**: Durable Objects for global state management
**Algorithm**: Token bucket with burst capacity
**Scope**: Per-user and per-IP limits
**Enforcement**: API gateway level

## Performance Targets

### API Performance
- p95 response time: <200ms
- JSON formatting: <50ms for 1MB files
- Code execution: <5s with progress feedback
- File uploads: Streaming with progress

### Frontend Performance
- First Contentful Paint: <3s
- Tool interactions: <100ms perceived response
- File processing: Real-time progress updates

### Scalability Targets
- Concurrent users: 1000+ (MVP)
- Daily active users: 10,000+
- File processing: 100+ concurrent jobs
- API requests: 10,000+ requests/day

## Security Considerations

### Code Execution Security
- WASM sandbox isolation
- No external network access
- Resource quotas and timeouts
- Malicious code detection patterns

### Data Privacy
- Automatic file cleanup (72h)
- No persistent data storage for inputs
- Encrypted transit and storage
- GDPR compliance considerations

### Access Control
- Turnstile for bot protection
- JWT authentication for premium features
- Rate limiting per user tier
- Audit logging for security events

## MVP Scope Definition

### Core Tools (MVP)
1. **JSON Tools**: Format, validate, convert (XML/YAML/CSV)
2. **Code Formatting**: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL
3. **Online Execution**: JavaScript, Python (basic)
4. **Text Tools**: Base64, URL encoding, timestamp conversion

### Infrastructure (MVP)
- User authentication (OAuth providers)
- File upload/download (R2)
- Basic rate limiting
- Turnstile protection
- Error tracking (Sentry)

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- Image processing tools
- Network tools
- Advanced encryption
- User management system
- Billing/subscriptions

## Integration Requirements

### Cloudflare Services
- Pages: Frontend hosting
- Workers: API runtime
- D1: User data and job tracking
- KV: Session caching
- R2: File storage
- Durable Objects: Rate limiting and session state
- Queues: Async job processing
- Images: Future image processing

### External Services
- Sentry: Error tracking and monitoring
- OAuth providers: User authentication
- CDN: Static asset delivery

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **WASM limitations**: Some libraries may not compile to WASM
  - Mitigation: Pre-research all required libraries
- **Performance at scale**: Edge performance under load
  - Mitigation: Load testing, monitoring
- **Cloudflare service limits**: Usage quotas and rate limits
  - Mitigation: Design for graceful degradation

### Business Risks
- **Competition**: Established tools like JSON.cn
  - Mitigation: Better UX, more comprehensive toolset
- **Monetization**: Converting free users to paid
  - Mitigation: Clear value proposition for premium features
