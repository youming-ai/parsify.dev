  }
}
```

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Incident Detection
1. **Automated Alert**: Monitoring system detects anomaly
2. **Initial Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Alert Team**: Notify incident response team
4. **Create Incident Channel**: Set up dedicated Slack channel

#### Step 2: Incident Triage
```bash
# Initial triage script
#!/bin/bash
# incident-triage.sh

INCIDENT_ID="INC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
echo "Incident $INCIDENT_ID detected at $(date)"

# Initial assessment
echo "=== Initial Assessment ==="
curl -f https://api.parsify.dev/health || echo "API Health Check Failed"
curl -f https://parsify.dev/api/health || echo "Frontend Health Check Failed"

# Error rate check
ERROR_COUNT=$(wrangler tail --env production --since=5m | grep -c ERROR)
echo "Error count (last 5 minutes): $ERROR_COUNT"

# Response time check
RESPONSE_TIME=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{time_total}" https://api.parsify.dev/health)
echo "API Response Time: ${RESPONSE_TIME}s"

# Create incident channel
curl -X POST "https://slack.com/api/conversations.create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"name\": \"incident-$INCIDENT_ID\"}"
```

#### Step 3: Severity Assessment

Use the following criteria to assess severity:

1. **User Impact**: How many users are affected?
2. **Business Impact**: What is the revenue/business impact?
3. **Service Impact**: Which services are affected?
4. **Data Impact**: Is there data loss or corruption?

### Phase 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)

#### Step 4: Form Investigation Team
```bash
# Incident team assembly
echo "=== Assembling Incident Response Team ==="
echo "Incident Commander: $INCIDENT_COMMANDER"
echo "Technical Lead: $TECHNICAL_LEAD"
echo "Communications Lead: $COMMUNICATIONS_LEAD"
echo "Support Lead: $SUPPORT_LEAD"
```

#### Step 5: Gather Information
1. **System Status**: Check all system components
2. **Recent Changes**: Review recent deployments and changes
3. **Log Analysis**: Review error logs and metrics
4. **User Reports**: Analyze user feedback and support tickets

#### Step 6: Identify Root Cause
1. **Hypothesis Formation**: Based on available information
2. **Testing**: Test hypotheses to isolate the cause
3. **Confirmation**: Verify root cause identification
4. **Documentation**: Document findings and evidence

### Phase 3: Resolution and Recovery (60-240 minutes)

#### Step 7: Implement Fix
```bash
# Resolution implementation example
echo "=== Implementing Resolution ==="

# Option 1: Quick fix (temporary)
echo "Applying temporary fix..."
# Apply configuration change, restart service, etc.

# Option 2: Rollback (if deployment issue)
echo "Rolling back deployment..."
cd apps/api && wrangler rollback --env production
cd apps/web && vercel rollback --scope parsify-dev --prod

# Option 3: Scale resources (if resource issue)
echo "Scaling resources..."
# Add more workers, increase capacity, etc.
```

#### Step 8: Verify Resolution
1. **Health Checks**: Confirm all services are healthy
2. **Functional Testing**: Test critical user journeys
3. **Performance Validation**: Verify performance is acceptable
4. **User Testing**: Confirm users can access services

#### Step 9: Monitor Stabilization
```bash
# Post-resolution monitoring
echo "=== Monitoring System Stabilization ==="

for i in {1..12}; do
  echo "Check $i/12 - $(date)"
  
  # Health checks
  curl -f https://api.parsify.dev/health || echo "❌ API Unhealthy"
  curl -f https://parsify.dev/api/health || echo "❌ Frontend Unhealthy"
  
  # Error rate check
  ERROR_COUNT=$(wrangler tail --env production --since=5m | grep -c ERROR)
  echo "Error rate: $ERROR_COUNT errors/5min"
  
  sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes between checks
done
```

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Activities (24-72 hours)

#### Step 10: Incident Closure
1. **Resolution Confirmation**: Verify incident is fully resolved
2. **Stabilization Period**: Monitor for 24 hours
3. **Formal Closure**: Declare incident closed
4. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform all stakeholders of resolution

#### Step 11: Post-Mortem Analysis
1. **Timeline Creation**: Detailed incident timeline
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes
3. **Impact Assessment**: Measure business and user impact
4. **Lessons Learned**: Document key takeaways

#### Step 12: Action Items
1. **Preventive Measures**: Actions to prevent recurrence
2. **Process Improvements**: Improve response procedures
3. **System Improvements**: Technical improvements
4. **Training Needs**: Identify training requirements
