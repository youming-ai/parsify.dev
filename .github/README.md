## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   # Make changes
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   # Create Pull Request to develop
   ```

2. **Staging Deployment**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/new-feature
   git push origin develop
   # Automatically deploys to staging
   ```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Access Control

- Use environment protection rules for production deployments
- Require approval for production deployments
- Limit access to sensitive secrets
- Use least-privilege access for deployment keys

### Security Scanning

- Security scans run on every push and PR
- Critical vulnerabilities block deployments
- All security findings are reported as GitHub issues
- Regular dependency updates are recommended

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to the repository
- Use GitHub encrypted secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets for different environments

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks

- Automated uptime monitoring every 6 hours
- Health checks after every deployment
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Error rate tracking

### Alerts

- GitHub issues created for critical issues
- Slack notifications for deployments and failures
