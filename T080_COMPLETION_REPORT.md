## 🛠️ Mocking Strategy

### Comprehensive Mock Implementation
- **Mock WASM Modules**: Simulate actual WASM behavior when modules aren't available
- **Performance API Mocks**: Mock timing and performance measurements  
- **Crypto API Mocks**: Mock UUID generation and random values
- **Network Mocks**: Mock fetch and other network operations
- **Security Sandboxes**: Mock secure execution environments

### Mock Registry
- Centralized mock management in `mocks/wasm-mocks.ts`
- Mock implementations for all major WASM services
- Test data generators for various scenarios
- Helper utilities for common test patterns

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Vitest Integration
- ✅ Integrated with existing Vitest configuration
- ✅ TypeScript support with proper path resolution
- ✅ Coverage reporting with v8 provider
- ✅ Test timeout and hook configuration
- ✅ Proper setup/teardown procedures

### Test Environment
- ✅ Node.js environment configuration
- ✅ WebAssembly API mocking
